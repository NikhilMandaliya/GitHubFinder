# GitHub Finder

Welcome to the GitHub Finder project, a collaborative effort between two friends, aimed at learning React through the creation of a user profile search tool. 

GitHub Finder utilizes React, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and the GitHub API to fetch and display user details.

With GitHub Finder, you can easily search for GitHub users and view their profiles. This project provides a user-friendly interface for exploring GitHub user information.
